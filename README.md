# 🧠 IDFS: The Adaptive Resilience Framework

**Integrated Data Fabric Strategy (IDFS)** is a methodology for eliminating data silos and transforming fragile integrations into antifragile, self-healing systems. Designed for organizations facing operational chaos, IDFS fuses governance, composability, and autonomous AI to create a resilient data ecosystem.
